# Build Status Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Header Component (`components/layout/header.tsx`)
- Fixed import statement to include both [CampusSelector](file://e:\comsats-ite-app_5\components\layout\campus-selector.tsx#L26-L193) and [CampusSelectorCompact](file://e:\comsats-ite-app_5\components\layout\campus-selector.tsx#L196-L234)
- Restructured layout to group logo and campus selector together
- Added proper responsive classes for mobile/desktop display
- Standardized button heights to `h-9` for consistency

### 2. Campus Selector Component (`components/layout/campus-selector.tsx`)
- Verified both [CampusSelector](file://e:\comsats-ite-app_5\components\layout\campus-selector.tsx#L26-L193) and [CampusSelectorCompact](file://e:\comsats-ite-app_5\components\layout\campus-selector.tsx#L196-L234) are properly exported
- Added `h-9` class to all buttons for consistency
- Implemented text truncation for better mobile display

## Issues Encountered

### TypeScript Compilation Errors
When running `npx tsc --noEmit` on individual files, we encountered path resolution errors:
- Cannot find module '@/components/...' or its corresponding type declarations
- JSX errors related to missing '--jsx' flag

These errors are likely due to:
1. TypeScript not using the project's tsconfig.json properly when checking individual files
2. Next.js specific module resolution that requires the full build context

### Build Process
The `npm run build` command starts successfully but appears to hang during the build process. This could be due to:
1. Large project size requiring more time to build
2. Resource constraints during compilation
3. Potential circular dependencies or complex module resolution

## Verification Steps Taken

1. ✅ Checked file paths and imports are correct
2. ✅ Verified component exports are properly defined
3. ✅ Confirmed responsive classes are correctly applied
4. ✅ Ensured button sizing is consistent
5. ✅ Validated mobile/desktop layout separation

## Next Steps

1. **Try alternative build approach**: Use `next build` directly instead of npm script
2. **Check system resources**: Ensure adequate memory and CPU for build process
3. **Verify dependencies**: Confirm all required packages are installed
4. **Test development server**: Run `npm run dev` to verify components work in development

## Expected Outcome

Once the build issues are resolved, the navbar should function correctly with:
- Proper alignment of Sign In button on desktop
- No overlay issues on mobile
- Consistent campus selector display across devices
- Maintained functionality for all interactive elements
