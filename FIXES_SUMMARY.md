# Project Fixes & Improvements Summary

## Date: October 8, 2025

### Issues Fixed

#### 1. ✅ Lost & Found Image Upload Feature
**Problem:** No image upload capability in Lost & Found module

**Solution:**
- Created Supabase storage bucket `lost-found-images` with public read access
- Updated `/api/lost-found/route.ts` to handle multipart form data and image uploads
- Added file input with preview in the Lost & Found dialog
- Implemented image display in Lost & Found item cards
- Added validation for image types (JPG, PNG, WebP, GIF) and size (5MB max)
- Made UI mobile-friendly with responsive image displays

**Files Modified:**
- `app/api/lost-found/route.ts`
- `app/lost-found/page.tsx`
- `supabase/migrations/20251008170000_setup_storage_bucket.sql`

#### 2. ✅ Past Papers 404 Issue
**Problem:** Past papers showing 404 when trying to access individual course papers

**Solution:**
- Fixed exam type mapping in API routes to handle both `type` and `exam_type` columns
- Updated `/api/past-papers/[courseCode]/route.ts` to properly map exam types
- Added support for `Midterm` → `Mid-Term` conversion
- Ensured backward compatibility with existing data

**Files Modified:**
- `app/api/past-papers/[courseCode]/route.ts`
- `app/api/past-papers/route.ts`

#### 3. ✅ Database Schema Verification
**Problem:** Inconsistencies in database schema

**Solution:**
- Created migration to verify all required tables exist
- Added `courses` table if missing
- Ensured `exam_type` and `type` columns exist in `past_papers`
- Added proper indexes for better query performance
- Configured RLS (Row Level Security) policies

**Files Created:**
- `supabase/migrations/20251008171000_verify_schema.sql`

#### 4. ✅ Supabase Integration
**Solution:**
- Linked project to Supabase (project ref: `ctixprrqbnfivhepifsa`)
- Configured environment variables in `.env.local`
- Set up storage buckets with proper permissions
- Pushed all migrations to remote database

### Environment Configuration

The following environment variables are configured in `.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://ctixprrqbnfivhepifsa.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[configured]
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=[configured]
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://campusaxis.site
```

### Testing Checklist

- [x] Supabase connection established
- [x] Database schema migrated
- [x] Storage bucket created for lost-found images
- [ ] Lost & Found image upload (needs testing with auth)
- [ ] Past Papers browsing and downloads
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Error handling

### Next Steps

1. **Test Lost & Found Module:**
   - Log in as an authenticated user
   - Try uploading a lost/found item with an image
   - Verify image appears in the card
   - Test on mobile device

2. **Test Past Papers Module:**
   - Browse to `/past-papers`
   - Click on any course
   - Verify papers are displayed correctly
   - Try downloading a paper

3. **Build & Deploy:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run start
   ```

### Known Improvements

1. **Mobile Optimization:**
   - Image upload input is touch-friendly
   - Preview shows properly on small screens
   - Cards are responsive

2. **Error Handling:**
   - File size validation (5MB limit)
   - File type validation (images only)
   - User-friendly error messages via toast notifications

3. **Performance:**
   - Added database indexes
   - Optimized image storage with Supabase CDN
   - Lazy loading for large lists

### Supabase CLI Commands Used

```bash
# Link project
supabase link --project-ref ctixprrqbnfivhepifsa

# Pull current schema
supabase db pull

# Push migrations
supabase db push

# Check status
supabase status
```

### API Endpoints

#### Lost & Found
- `GET /api/lost-found` - Fetch items with filtering
- `POST /api/lost-found` - Create new item with image (multipart/form-data)

#### Past Papers
- `GET /api/past-papers` - List all papers with filters
- `GET /api/past-papers/[courseCode]` - Get papers for specific course
- `POST /api/past-papers` - Upload new paper

### Storage Buckets

- **lost-found-images**: Public read, authenticated write
  - Max file size: 5MB
  - Allowed types: image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp, image/gif

### Database Tables

1. **lost_found_items**
   - Contains `image_url` column for uploaded images
   - RLS enabled for security

2. **past_papers**
   - Contains both `type` and `exam_type` columns
   - Indexed for performance

3. **courses**
   - Course information
   - Public read access

## Troubleshooting

### If images don't upload:
1. Check Supabase storage bucket permissions
2. Verify user is authenticated
3. Check file size (must be < 5MB)
4. Check file type (must be image)

### If past papers show 404:
1. Verify papers exist in database
2. Check course code matches exactly
3. Verify `type` or `exam_type` column has valid values

### If builds fail:
1. Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
2. Check TypeScript errors with `npm run build`
3. Verify environment variables are set
