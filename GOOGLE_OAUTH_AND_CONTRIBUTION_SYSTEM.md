## 📊 3. Technical Details

### Database Tables Used:
1. ✅ `past_papers` - Downloads, helpful_count
2. ✅ `reviews` - Helpful_count, comment length
3. ✅ `community_posts` - Likes, comment_count
4. ✅ `help_desk_tickets` - Status (resolved count)
5. ✅ `lost_found_items` - Status (found count)
6. ✅ `user_preferences` - Campus, department

### Point Calculation Logic:
```typescript
// Example calculation:
User A:

Total = 1,875 points → Super Contributor badge 🥇
```

### Ranking Algorithm:
1. Fetch all users (with optional campus filter)
2. Calculate points for each user from all sources
3. Sort by category (overall or specific)
4. Assign ranks (1, 2, 3, ..., N)
5. Add rank badges (Champion, Top 10, etc.)
6. Return top 50
