## 🔴 YOUR NEXT 3 STEPS (10 minutes total)

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration (2 minutes)

**The SQL is ALREADY IN YOUR CLIPBOARD!**

Just do this:

1. **Open this URL:**
   ```
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ctixprrqbnfivhepifsa
   ```

2. **Click:** "SQL Editor" (in left sidebar)

3. **Click:** "New Query" button

4. **Paste:** Press `Ctrl+V` (the SQL is already copied!)

5. **Click:** "Run" button (green button)

6. **Wait:** See "Success. No rows returned"

**Done! ✅**

---

### Step 2: Verify Everything Works (3 minutes)

Run this command:

```bash
node scripts/verify.js
```

**Expected output:**
```
✓ Table 'post_reactions' - OK
✓ Table 'post_comments' - OK
✓ All features working
```

### Step 3: Test Your App (5 minutes)

**Your app is already open in the browser!**

If not, go to: http://localhost:3001

**Test these pages:**

1. **Homepage:** http://localhost:3001
   - Should load fine ✅

2. **Guidance:** http://localhost:3001/guidance
   - Should show 5 guidance items ✅
   - Should show 20 FAQs ✅

3. **Faculty:** http://localhost:3001/faculty
   - Should show 67 faculty members ✅

4. **Community:** http://localhost:3001/community
   - Should show "No posts yet" (not an error!) ✅

5. **News:** http://localhost:3001/news
   - Should show "No articles yet" (not an error!) ✅

## 🆘 Quick Help

### If SQL migration doesn't work:

1. Make sure you're logged into Supabase
2. Make sure you selected the right project
3. Try copying the SQL again:
   ```bash
   Get-Content supabase\migrations\20251012_fix_community_schema.sql | Set-Clipboard
   ```

### If verification fails:

```bash
# Rebuild
pnpm build

# Restart server
pnpm dev

# Try verification again
node scripts/verify.js
```
