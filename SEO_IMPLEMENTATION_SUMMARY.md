# SEO Implementation Summary for CampusAxis

## Overview
This document summarizes the SEO improvements implemented for the CampusAxis platform to enhance search engine visibility and crawling.

## Completed SEO Implementations

### 1. Sitemap Generation
- **Dynamic Sitemap Route**: The application already had a dynamic sitemap implementation at `/app/sitemap.ts`
- **Static Sitemap Generation**: Created a post-build script that generates a static `sitemap.xml` file in the public directory
- **Content**: Includes all key pages such as:
  - Main pages (home, about, contact, support)
  - Academic resources (GPA calculator, past papers, timetables)
  - Community features (forums, groups, events)
  - Faculty and admissions information
  - Student support resources

### 2. Robots.txt Configuration
- **Existing Configuration**: The project already had a properly configured `robots.txt` file
- **Sitemap Reference**: Includes reference to the generated sitemap
- **Disallow Rules**: Properly configured to prevent crawling of admin, API, and user-specific pages

### 3. Build Process Integration
- **Post-Build Hook**: Integrated sitemap generation into the build process using the `postbuild` script
- **Automation**: Sitemap is automatically regenerated with each build

## Technical Implementation Details
