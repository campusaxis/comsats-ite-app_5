## ‚è≥ Current Status

### Build Process
```bash
Status: IN PROGRESS
Command: pnpm build
Time: ~2-5 minutes (typical for large Next.js apps)
```

**What's Building:**
- Next.js 15.2.4 optimized production bundle
- PWA service worker compilation
- Static page generation
- Route optimization
- Asset minification
- Image optimization

---

## üìã Pre-Deployment Tasks

### 1. Wait for Build Completion ‚è±Ô∏è
**Current**: Building...
**Action**: Wait for terminal to show "Build completed" or "Export complete"
**Expected Time**: 2-5 minutes

**What to Look For:**
```
‚úì Compiled successfully
‚úì Collecting page data
‚úì Generating static pages
‚úì Finalizing page optimization
```

### 2. Check Build Output ‚úÖ
**Once build completes:**
```bash
# Check for errors
# Look for: "Build completed in XXs"
# Verify no error messages
```

**Expected Output:**
- Route count summary
- Static vs dynamic pages report
- Bundle size analysis
- No errors or warnings

### 3. Run Database Migration üóÑÔ∏è
**CRITICAL - Must do before testing features**

**Option A - Using Supabase CLI:**
```bash
supabase db push
```

**Option B - Manual in Supabase Dashboard:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. Open: `supabase/migrations/20251011100000_complete_notification_system.sql`
3. Copy entire file contents
4. Paste into SQL Editor
5. Click "Run"
6. Verify: "Success. 11 rows returned"

**What This Creates:**
- 11 tables (notifications, support_tickets, email_queue, etc.)
- RLS policies for security
- Database functions (create_notification, log_activity)
- Triggers for auto-updates
- 4 system roles (super_admin, admin, moderator, content_manager)
- 8 email configurations

---

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### After Database Migration:

#### Test 1: Role Management
- [ ] Go to `/admin/users`
- [ ] Click "Custom Roles" tab
- [ ] Create a test role (e.g., "Test Manager")
- [ ] Select 2-3 permissions
- [ ] Verify role appears in list
- [ ] Delete test role
- [ ] Verify role is removed

#### Test 2: User Promotion
- [ ] Go to `/admin/users` ‚Üí "Users" tab
- [ ] Find a test user
- [ ] Click "Promote" button
- [ ] Select role and permissions
- [ ] Verify promotion succeeds
- [ ] Check "Admins" tab to see promoted user

#### Test 3: Share Button
- [ ] Visit any blog post
- [ ] Scroll to ShareButton
- [ ] Click share icon
- [ ] Verify native share dialog (mobile) or social options (desktop)
- [ ] Test one social share link

#### Test 4: Admin Dashboard
- [ ] Go to `/admin/dashboard`
- [ ] Verify stats cards load
- [ ] Check system health indicators
- [ ] Verify no console errors

#### Test 5: Activity Logs
- [ ] Go to `/admin/activity`
- [ ] Verify logs appear

## üåê Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)
```bash
# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: integrated role management, added share/SEO features"
git push origin main

# Vercel auto-deploys on push
# Visit: https://vercel.com/your-project/deployments
```

**Vercel Deployment:**
1. Push triggers automatic build
2. Build runs in Vercel cloud (~2-3 minutes)
3. Preview deployment created
4. Review before promoting to production
5. One-click promote to production

**Environment Variables in Vercel:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `RESEND_API_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`

### Option 2: Manual Build + Deploy
```bash
# If build completes successfully
pnpm build

# Start production server locally (test first)
pnpm start

# Or deploy build folder to your hosting
# Upload .next folder + public folder + package.json
```

## üîí Security Checklist

Before going live:

- [ ] Database RLS policies enabled (done in migration)
- [ ] API routes check user authentication
- [ ] Admin routes protected by AdminGuard
- [ ] Service role key stored securely (not in client code)
- [ ] CORS configured properly
- [ ] Environment variables set in production
- [ ] No console.log with sensitive data

---

## üìä Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Week 1 - Watch For:
1. **Error Rates**
   - Check Vercel logs for 500 errors
   - Monitor Supabase logs for database errors
   - Review browser console for client errors

2. **Performance**
   - Page load times (should be <2s)
   - Time to Interactive (TTI)
   - Lighthouse scores (aim for 90+)

3. **User Behavior**
   - Share button usage (check share_analytics table)
   - Role management adoption
   - Support ticket volume

### Tools to Use:
- Vercel Analytics (free tier)
- Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Logs
- Browser DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
- Google Search Console (for SEO)

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
**Problem**: Build process exits with error
**Solution**: 
1. Check terminal output for specific error
2. Run `pnpm typecheck` to find TS errors
3. Run `pnpm lint` to find code issues
4. Clear build cache: `rm -rf .next` then rebuild

### Database Migration Fails
**Problem**: SQL script errors
**Solution**:
1. Check if tables already exist
2. Drop existing tables if testing: `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS table_name CASCADE;`
3. Run migration again
4. Check Supabase logs for detailed error

### Share Button Not Working
**Problem**: Share dialog doesn't appear
**Solution**:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify `contentId` is passed correctly
3. Test in different browser (Safari, Chrome, Firefox)
4. Check if Web Share API is supported

### Role Management Issues
**Problem**: Can't create/delete roles
**Solution**:
1. Verify user is authenticated
2. Check user has `manage_roles` permission
3. Look at browser Network tab for API errors
4. Check Supabase logs for RLS policy blocks
