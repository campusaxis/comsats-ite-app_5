## üé® FIXED: Light Mode Gradient Issue

### Problem Identified
Dark gradient colors (`#0f1115`, `#181c22`, `#1a1f27`) were bleeding into light mode on hero sections of multiple pages.

### Root Cause
Tailwind's dark mode classes were not properly separated. Using `bg-gradient-to-br from-white ... dark:from-[#0f1115]` causes the gradient direction to apply in both modes, only changing colors.

### Solution Implemented
Changed gradient approach to use solid backgrounds in light mode:

**Before:**
```tsx
className="bg-gradient-to-br from-white via-blue-50/30 to-slate-50/50 dark:from-[#0f1115] dark:via-[#181c22] dark:to-[#1a1f27]"
```

**After:**
```tsx
className="bg-white dark:bg-gradient-to-br dark:from-[#0f1115] dark:via-[#181c22] dark:to-[#1a1f27]"
```

### Files Fixed:
‚úÖ `app/page.tsx` (Homepage hero section)
‚úÖ `app/comsats-gpa-calculator/page.tsx` (GPA calculator landing)
‚úÖ `app/comsats-past-papers/page.tsx` (Past papers landing)

### Additional Fix:
Updated glassmorphism overlay opacity for better light mode visibility:
```tsx
from-white/80 via-white/60 to-white/90 (was from-white/60 via-white/40 to-white/70)
```
