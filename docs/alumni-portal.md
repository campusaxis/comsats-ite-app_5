## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Structure
```
app/alumni/
├── page.tsx              # Main alumni portal dashboard
├── profile/
│   └── page.tsx          # Profile management page
└── settings/
    └── page.tsx          # Account settings page

components/alumni/
└── navbar.tsx            # Alumni portal navigation
```

### Backend API Routes
```
app/api/
├── profile/
│   └── route.ts          # Profile CRUD operations
└── user-emails/          # Existing email management API
```

### Database Schema
The alumni portal uses the existing `user_preferences` table with additional columns:
- `full_name` - User's full name
- `phone` - Phone number
- `address` - Physical address
- `company` - Current company
- `position` - Current position
- `graduation_year` - Graduation year
- `degree` - Degree information

## User Flow

1. **Authentication**: Alumni access the portal through the standard login process
2. **Email Management**: Users can add and verify personal email addresses
3. **Profile Setup**: Users can complete their alumni profile
4. **Settings Configuration**: Users can customize their preferences
5. **Benefit Access**: Users can access exclusive alumni features

## Design System

The alumni portal follows the glassmorphism UI/UX design preference with 2025 latest design trends:
- Glassmorphism cards with backdrop blur effects
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Gradient accents and modern color schemes
- Responsive layout for all device sizes
- Consistent navigation and user experience

## Security Considerations

- All API routes are protected with authentication checks
- Email verification is required for new email addresses
- Password changes follow standard security practices
- Account deletion requires confirmation
- User data is protected with Row Level Security (RLS) policies

## Future Enhancements

Planned features for future releases:
- Alumni networking directory
- Event registration and management
- Career services integration
- Alumni achievement tracking
- Social features and community building
