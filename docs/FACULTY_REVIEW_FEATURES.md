# Faculty Review Features Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of two new features for the faculty review system:
1. **Student Opinion on Reviews**: Allow students to agree/disagree with faculty reviews
2. **Student-Submitted Faculty**: Allow students to add faculty members pending admin approval

## Features Implemented

### 1. Review Opinion System (Agree/Disagree)

#### Database Schema
Created `review_opinions` table:
- `id`: UUID (Primary Key)
- `review_id`: UUID (Foreign Key to reviews)
- `user_id`: UUID (Foreign Key to users)
- `opinion`: TEXT ('agree' or 'disagree')
- `created_at`: Timestamp
- Unique constraint on (review_id, user_id) - one opinion per user per review

#### API Endpoints
**`/api/reviews/opinions`** (POST):
- Submit or update opinion on a review
- Toggle functionality: clicking same button removes opinion
- Change opinion: clicking opposite button updates opinion

**`/api/reviews/opinions`** (GET):
- Fetch opinion statistics for a review
- Returns: agreeCount, disagreeCount, totalOpinions, userOpinion

#### Components
**`ReviewOpinionButtons`** (`components/faculty/review-opinion-buttons.tsx`):
- Two buttons: Agree (green) and Disagree (red)
- Shows count for each opinion
- Highlights user's current opinion
- Real-time updates without page refresh
- Integrated into ReviewCard component

#### User Experience
- Students can see how many others agree/disagree with a review
- Visual feedback shows which option they selected
- Helps gauge community consensus on review accuracy
- Toggle behavior allows changing or removing opinion

### 2. Student-Submitted Faculty System

#### Database Schema
Created `pending_faculty` table:
- `id`: UUID (Primary Key)
- `name`: TEXT (Faculty name)
- `department`: TEXT
- `designation`: TEXT (Professor, Lecturer, etc.)
- `email`: TEXT (optional)
- `phone`: TEXT (optional)
- `specialization`: TEXT (optional)
- `qualifications`: TEXT (optional)
- `campus_id`: UUID (Foreign Key to campuses)
- `submitted_by`: UUID (Foreign Key to users)
- `status`: TEXT ('pending', 'approved', 'rejected')
- `submitted_at`: Timestamp
- `reviewed_at`: Timestamp
- `reviewer_notes`: TEXT (admin notes)
- `approved_faculty_id`: UUID (if approved, reference to faculty table)
- Unique constraint on (name, campus_id)

#### API Endpoints

**`/api/faculty/pending`** (POST):
- Students submit new faculty member
- Validates required fields (name, department, campus, submitter)
- Checks for duplicates in faculty and pending_faculty tables
- Creates pending entry with status 'pending'

**`/api/faculty/pending`** (GET):
- Students view their submitted faculty
- Filter by userId, campusId, status

**`/api/admin/faculty/pending`** (POST):
- Admin approve or reject pending faculty
- On approval: creates faculty record, updates pending status
- On rejection: updates pending status with notes
- Requires admin authentication

**`/api/admin/faculty/pending`** (GET):
- Admin view all pending faculty submissions
- Filter by status
- Includes submitter and campus information

#### Components

**`AddFacultyDialog`** (`components/faculty/add-faculty-dialog.tsx`):
- Modal dialog for students to submit faculty
- Form fields: name, department, designation, email, phone, specialization, qualifications
- Auto-fills campus from user's selected campus
- Shows informational note about approval process
- Validation and error handling

**`PendingFacultyReviewPage`** (`app/admin/faculty-pending/page.tsx`):
- Admin interface to review pending submissions
- Shows faculty details, submitter info, submission date
- Review notes textarea for admin comments
- Approve/Reject buttons
- Real-time status updates
- Admin access guard

#### User Experience

**For Students:**
1. Click "Add Faculty Member" button on faculty listing page
2. Fill out faculty information form
3. Submit for admin approval
4. Receive notification about submission status
5. Can track submission status

**For Admins:**
1. Access "Pending Faculty" from admin dashboard (high priority)
2. View all pending submissions in card format
3. Review faculty details and submitter information
4. Add optional review notes
5. Approve (creates faculty record) or Reject (with reason)
6. Automatic notifications to submitter

## Integration Points

### Faculty Listing Page (`app/faculty/page.tsx`)
- Added "Add Faculty Member" button next to filters
- Opens AddFacultyDialog component
- Visible to all authenticated students

### Review Card Component (`components/faculty/review-card.tsx`)
- Added ReviewOpinionButtons at bottom of each review
- Positioned next to Helpful/Report buttons
- Shows real-time opinion counts

### Admin Dashboard (`app/admin/page.tsx`)
- Added "Pending Faculty" as high-priority link
- Icon: âœ…
- Description: "Review and approve student-submitted faculty members"

## Security Considerations

1. **Row Level Security (RLS)**:
   - `review_opinions`: Users can only insert/update/delete their own opinions
   - `pending_faculty`: Users can only insert their own submissions
   - Admin updates handled via service role

2. **Authentication**:
   - All endpoints require user authentication
   - Admin endpoints verify admin privileges
   - User ID from authenticated session (not request body)

3. **Validation**:
   - Server-side validation for all inputs
   - Duplicate prevention for opinions and faculty submissions
   - Required field validation
   - Email/phone format validation

4. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Should be added for opinion endpoints to prevent spam
   - Consider daily limits for faculty submissions

## Database Migration

File: `supabase/migrations/add_review_opinions_and_pending_faculty.sql`

Includes:
- Table creation for both features
- Indexes for performance
- RLS policies
- Constraints and checks
- Documentation comments

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
1. `app/api/reviews/opinions/route.ts` - Opinion API
2. `app/api/faculty/pending/route.ts` - Student faculty submission API
3. `app/api/admin/faculty/pending/route.ts` - Admin approval API
4. `components/faculty/review-opinion-buttons.tsx` - Opinion UI component
5. `components/faculty/add-faculty-dialog.tsx` - Faculty submission dialog
6. `app/admin/faculty-pending/page.tsx` - Admin review interface
7. `supabase/migrations/add_review_opinions_and_pending_faculty.sql` - Database schema

### Modified Files:
1. `app/faculty/page.tsx` - Added AddFacultyDialog button
2. `components/faculty/review-card.tsx` - Added ReviewOpinionButtons

## Next Steps

### Recommended Enhancements:
1. **Notifications**:
   - Email students when faculty is approved/rejected
   - Notify admins of new pending faculty submissions
   - Real-time notification badges in admin panel

2. **Analytics**:
   - Track opinion distribution per review
   - Show trending reviews (high agreement/disagreement)
   - Admin dashboard stats for pending faculty

3. **Gamification**:
   - Award points for submitting faculty (after approval)
   - Bonus points for helpful faculty submissions
   - Badge for "Faculty Contributor"

4. **Search & Filters**:
   - Filter reviews by opinion consensus
   - Search pending faculty by department/campus
   - Bulk approve/reject options for admins

5. **Quality Controls**:
   - Minimum character limit for faculty qualifications
   - Auto-detect duplicate faculty names (fuzzy matching)
   - Require email verification for faculty submissions
   - Track approval/rejection rates per user

## Deployment Notes

2. Verify RLS policies are active
3. Test admin authentication
4. Monitor for duplicate submissions
5. Set up monitoring for pending faculty queue

---

## Support & Maintenance

**Common Issues:**
- **Opinion not updating**: Check user authentication, verify RLS policies
- **Faculty not appearing after approval**: Check approved_faculty_id link, verify faculty table insert
- **Duplicate submissions**: Verify unique constraint, check case sensitivity in name matching
- **Admin access denied**: Verify admin role assignment, check isAdmin() function

**Monitoring:**
- Track pending faculty queue size
- Monitor opinion spam patterns
- Analyze approval/rejection rates
- Review admin response times
