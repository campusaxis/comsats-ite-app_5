```

### Animation Context Integration

Celebration animations are managed through the animation context:

```typescript
import { useAnimation } from "@/contexts/animation-context"
import { useCelebrationAnimations } from "@/hooks/use-celebration-animations"

const { isAnimationEnabled } = useAnimation()
const { triggerConfetti } = useCelebrationAnimations()
```

### Notification System Integration

Toast notifications are used for important motivational messages:

```typescript
import { useToast } from "@/components/ui/use-toast"

const { toast } = useToast()
```

    triggerConfetti({
      message: "Welcome to CampusAxis!",
      duration: 3000,
      particleCount: 150
    })
    
    triggerFeedback({
      type: 'achievement_unlocked',
      message: "Welcome to CampusAxis!"
    })
  }
}
```
