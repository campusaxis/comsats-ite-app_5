## User Experience Improvements

3. **Visual Feedback**: Icons for key fields (office, specialization, courses)
4. **Consistent Experience**: Matches the admin panel interface for familiarity

## Technical Implementation

The enhancement maintains backward compatibility while extending functionality:

1. **Frontend**: The dialog component now collects all relevant faculty information
2. **API**: The pending faculty endpoint accepts and stores all fields
3. **Database**: Schema migration adds the necessary columns
4. **Admin Process**: Approval workflow transfers all fields to the main faculty table

## Testing

The changes have been verified through:
- Successful build process
- Component rendering tests
- API endpoint validation
- Database schema migration

## Impact

This enhancement allows students to provide comprehensive information when submitting new faculty members, reducing the administrative burden on admins who previously had to manually add missing details.
