Archived: APPLY_FIX.bat (legacy helper)

Reason: Replaced by scriptable package.json tasks and TypeScript/PowerShell scripts under scripts/. The batch file pointed to an outdated migration (20250109) while package.json uses 20251009.

Use instead:
- pnpm db:apply-admin-fix
- pnpm db:seed
- pnpm db:seed-complete
