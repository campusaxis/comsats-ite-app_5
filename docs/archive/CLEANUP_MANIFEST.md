- STRUCTURE_REFACTOR_SUMMARY.md → docs/archive/STRUCTURE_REFACTOR_SUMMARY.md
- REFACTORING_COMPLETE.md → docs/FINAL_ENHANCEMENT_SUMMARY.md (canonical reference)

## Removed (generated or ad-hoc)
- test-api.js (ad-hoc script)
- test-community-api.js (ad-hoc script)
- build.log (generated)
- build_errors.txt (generated)
- build_output.txt (generated)
- APPLY_FIX.bat (legacy helper; archived as docs/archive/APPLY_FIX.bat.txt)

## Notes
