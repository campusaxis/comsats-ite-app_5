## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Table: `review_opinions`
```sql
CREATE TABLE review_opinions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  review_id UUID REFERENCES reviews(id),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  opinion TEXT CHECK (opinion IN ('agree', 'disagree')),
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(review_id, user_id)
);
```

**Purpose**: Track student opinions on faculty reviews

**RLS Policies**:
- Anyone can view opinions (public data)
- Users can only insert/update/delete their own opinions
- Prevents opinion spam and manipulation

### Table: `pending_faculty`
```sql
CREATE TABLE pending_faculty (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  department TEXT NOT NULL,
  designation TEXT DEFAULT 'Lecturer',
  email TEXT,
  phone TEXT,
  specialization TEXT,
  qualifications TEXT,
  campus_id UUID REFERENCES campuses(id),
  submitted_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  status TEXT CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'approved', 'rejected')),
  submitted_at TIMESTAMP,
  reviewed_at TIMESTAMP,
  reviewer_notes TEXT,
  approved_faculty_id UUID REFERENCES faculty(id),
  UNIQUE(name, campus_id)
);
```

**Purpose**: Queue faculty submissions for admin approval

**RLS Policies**:
- Anyone can view (to check for duplicates)
- Authenticated users can submit
- Only admins can update (via service role)

## üîí Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization:
- ‚úÖ All endpoints require user authentication
- ‚úÖ Admin endpoints verify admin privileges via `isAdmin()` function
- ‚úÖ User IDs from session (not request body) prevent impersonation

### Data Validation:
- ‚úÖ Server-side input validation with TypeScript
- ‚úÖ Required field enforcement (name, department, campus)
- ‚úÖ Opinion constraint: only 'agree' or 'disagree'
- ‚úÖ Status constraint: only 'pending', 'approved', 'rejected'

### Duplicate Prevention:
- ‚úÖ Unique constraint on (review_id, user_id) for opinions
- ‚úÖ Unique constraint on (name, campus_id) for pending faculty
- ‚úÖ Check existing faculty and pending before insert
- ‚úÖ Case-insensitive name matching

### Row Level Security (RLS):
- ‚úÖ Opinion table: users can only modify their own data
- ‚úÖ Pending faculty: users can only submit, admins can approve
- ‚úÖ Public read access for transparency

## üéì Usage Examples

### Example 1: Agreeing with a Review
```typescript

  reviewId: "abc-123",
  userId: "user-456",
  action: "agree"
}
// Result: Green thumbs up, count increases
// Display: "You agreed ‚Ä¢ 24 agree, 3 disagree"
```

  name: "Dr. Sara Ahmed",
  department: "Computer Science",
  designation: "Assistant Professor",
  email: "sara.ahmed@comsats.edu.pk",
  specialization: "Machine Learning, AI",
  campus_id: "lahore-campus-id",
  submitted_by: "user-789"
}
// API: POST /api/faculty/pending

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Opinion not updating
**Solution**: Check user authentication, verify RLS policies, inspect network tab for API errors

### Issue: Faculty not appearing after approval
**Solution**: Verify `approved_faculty_id` is set, check faculty table insert succeeded, clear cache

### Issue: Duplicate submission error
**Solution**: Check existing faculty and pending tables, verify name matching (case-insensitive), inform user

### Issue: Admin access denied
**Solution**: Verify admin role in users table, check `isAdmin()` function, ensure session valid

## üìù Notes for Developers

### Code Structure:
- **API routes** follow RESTful conventions
- **Components** use TypeScript with strict typing
- **State management** via React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- **Error handling** with try-catch and user-friendly messages
- **Loading states** for better UX during async operations

### Best Practices:
- ‚úÖ Always validate on server-side (never trust client)
- ‚úÖ Use optimistic UI updates for instant feedback
- ‚úÖ Include loading spinners for async operations
- ‚úÖ Show clear error messages to users
- ‚úÖ Log errors for debugging (console.error)
- ‚úÖ Use TypeScript interfaces for type safety

### Performance Optimizations:
- Indexes on frequently queried columns
- Limit query results to prevent large payloads
- Cache opinion counts (future: Redis)
- Debounce rapid opinion changes
- Lazy load pending faculty list
