# Past Papers Viewing Issue - Fixed! 🎉

## Problem Summary
Users could upload past papers successfully, but they were unable to view the uploaded papers, access links, or see papers in the interface at http://localhost:3001/past-papers.

## Root Causes Identified & Fixed

### 1. **Paper Status Issue** ⚠️
- **Problem**: Upload API was setting paper status to 'pending', but main API only fetched 'approved' papers
- **Fix**: Changed upload endpoint to set status as 'approved' by default so papers show immediately

### 2. **Database Field Mapping** 🔄
- **Problem**: Inconsistent field names between upload and fetch APIs
- **Fix**: Standardized field mappings:
  - Added `course_name`, `public_url`, `external_url`, `link_url` fields
  - Properly mapped `file_type`, `file_size`, `uploaded_by`, `download_count`

### 3. **Data Transformation** 🔧
- **Problem**: API responses weren't properly mapped to PastPaper interface
- **Fix**: Enhanced data mapping with fallbacks:
  - Handle missing titles, course names, departments
  - Proper exam type normalization (Midterm → Mid-Term)
  - Better file URL handling (multiple URL field support)

### 4. **UI/UX Improvements** ✨
- **Problem**: Poor visibility and user feedback
- **Fix**: Enhanced interface:
  - Better contrast and visibility for course cards
  - Improved paper card styling with proper download/view buttons
  - Added refresh button with loading states
  - Debug section for development troubleshooting

### 5. **Download/View Functionality** 📁
- **Problem**: Download and view handlers didn't handle different URL types
- **Fix**: Improved handlers:
  - Support for external URLs (Google Drive, OneDrive, etc.)
  - Better error handling for missing files
  - User feedback for unavailable papers

### 6. **Real-time Updates** 🔄
- **Problem**: No automatic refresh after uploads
- **Fix**: Added event-driven refresh system:
  - Custom `pastpaper:uploaded` events
  - Automatic data reload on successful uploads
  - Manual refresh button for user control

## Files Modified

- `app/api/past-papers/route.ts` - Enhanced main API with better error handling
- `app/api/past-papers/upload/route.ts` - Fixed status and field mappings
