# Build Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### Route Conflict Resolution
**Problem**: You cannot have two parallel pages that resolve to the same path. Please check /blog/comsats-gpa-calculator-guide/page and /blog/comsats-gpa-calculator-guide/route.

**Solution**: 
- Deleted the conflicting `app/blog/comsats-gpa-calculator-guide/route.ts` file
- Kept the `app/blog/comsats-gpa-calculator-guide/page.tsx` file which properly handles the page rendering

## Current Status

### Development Server
✅ **Running Successfully** - The development server starts without errors:
- Local: http://localhost:3000
- Network: http://192.168.56.1:3000
- Ready in 5.9s

### Build Process
⚠️ **In Progress** - The build process appears to be running but taking longer than expected:
- Next.js 15.2.4
- Environments: .env.local
- Experiments: optimizeCss enabled
- Creating optimized production build...

## Verification Steps

1. ✅ Removed conflicting route.ts file in blog directory
2. ✅ Verified development server starts successfully
3. ✅ Confirmed no other route conflicts in the codebase
4. ⏳ Waiting for build process to complete

## Expected Outcome

Once the build completes successfully, the application will:
- Have resolved the route conflict issue
- Build without webpack errors
- Maintain all functionality including:
  - Navbar fixes for desktop and mobile
  - Campus selector improvements
  - Blog functionality
  - All other features

## Next Steps

1. Wait for build process to complete
2. Verify build output in .next directory
3. Test production build locally if successful
4. Deploy to production environment
