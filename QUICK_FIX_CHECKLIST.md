---

## 🎯 **YOU NEED TO DO (2 STEPS)**

### **Step 1: Set SERVICE_ROLE_KEY in Vercel** ⚠️ **CRITICAL**

1. Go to: **https://vercel.com/dashboard**
2. Open your project: **comsats-ite-app_5**
3. Go to: **Settings → Environment Variables**
4. Click: **Add New**
5. Set:
   - **Name**: `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   - **Value**: Get from https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ctixprrqbnfivhepifsa/settings/api
   - **Environments**: Production, Preview, Development (check all)
6. Click: **Save**
7. **Redeploy**: Go to Deployments → Latest → Click ⋯ → Redeploy

---

### **Step 2: Test Admin Access** 

After Vercel deployment completes (2-3 minutes):

1. Go to: **https://campusaxis.site/admin/auth**
2. You should be signed in already
3. Click: **"Continue as Admin"**
4. ✅ **Expected**: Access granted! Redirected to admin panel
5. ✅ **Verify**: You can see admin users list

---

## 🔍 **GET YOUR SERVICE_ROLE_KEY**

### **From Supabase Dashboard:**

1. **Go to**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ctixprrqbnfivhepifsa/settings/api

2. **Find section**: "Project API keys"

3. **Copy**: `service_role` key (the secret one)
   - Starts with: `eyJ...`
   - ⚠️ **WARNING**: This is a secret key - never commit to git!

4. **Paste** in Vercel environment variables

---

## 🚨 **IF YOU DON'T SET SERVICE_ROLE_KEY:**

Without the SERVICE_ROLE_KEY environment variable:
- ❌ Admin login will STILL fail with "Forbidden"
- ❌ The code will fallback to ANON_KEY
- ❌ RLS policies will block the query

**The SERVICE_ROLE_KEY is REQUIRED for the fix to work!**

---

## 📊 **DEPLOYMENT STATUS**

Check Vercel deployment:
- **Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
- **Logs**: Check for any errors during deployment

Expected deployment time: **2-3 minutes**

---

## ✅ **FINAL CHECK**

After setting SERVICE_ROLE_KEY and redeploying:

```
✅ Go to: https://campusaxis.site/admin/auth
✅ Click: "Continue as Admin"  
✅ Result: Admin panel loads
✅ Status: FIXED! 🎉
```

---

## 🎯 **WHAT WAS FIXED**

**Before:**
- Admin APIs used `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- Anon key respects RLS policies
- RLS blocked admin verification queries
- Result: "Access Denied - Forbidden"

**After:**
- Admin APIs use `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- Service role bypasses RLS policies
- Admin verification queries succeed
- Result: **Admin access works!** ✅

---

## 📞 **SUPPORT**

If still getting "Forbidden" after deployment:

1. **Verify SERVICE_ROLE_KEY is set** in Vercel
2. **Check it starts with** `eyJ...` (JWT token)
3. **Redeploy** after adding the key
4. **Clear browser cache** and try again
5. **Check Vercel logs** for any errors

**The fix is complete. Just add SERVICE_ROLE_KEY to Vercel!** 🚀
