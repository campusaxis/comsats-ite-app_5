# Color Harmony Improvement Plan

## Problem
The current UI uses harsh pink and purple gradients (e.g., `from-purple-500 to-pink-500` and `from-purple-600 to-pink-600`) that create visual noise and don't align with modern design principles. These gradients appear unprofessional and can cause eye strain.

## Solution
Replace harsh pink/purple gradients with more harmonious color combinations that:
1. Maintain the brand identity (COMSATS blue as primary)
2. Follow 2025 design trends
3. Improve visual comfort and reduce eye strain
4. Maintain glassmorphism effects
5. Ensure accessibility and proper contrast

## New Color Palette
### Primary Gradient (Brand Consistency)
- Current: `from-purple-600 to-pink-600`
- Improved: `from-blue-600 to-indigo-600` or `from-primary to-blue-600`

### Secondary Gradient (Visual Interest)
- Current: `from-purple-500 to-pink-500`
- Improved: `from-blue-500 to-cyan-500` or `from-indigo-500 to-purple-500`

### Accent Gradient (Special Cases)
- Current: `from-pink-600 to-purple-600`
- Improved: `from-cyan-500 to-blue-600` or `from-teal-500 to-cyan-500`

### Background/Decorative Gradients
- Current: `from-purple-500/20 to-pink-500/20`
- Improved: `from-blue-500/10 to-cyan-500/10` or `from-indigo-500/10 to-purple-500/10`

## Implementation Strategy
1. Replace all instances of harsh pink/purple gradients with harmonious alternatives
2. Maintain the same visual weight and contrast
3. Ensure accessibility standards are met
4. Preserve glassmorphism effects
5. Test in both light and dark modes
