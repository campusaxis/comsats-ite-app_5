### Architecture Principles

✅ **Clean Architecture**: Framework-independent core  
✅ **SOLID Principles**: Single responsibility, dependency inversion  
✅ **Feature-Slice Design**: Self-contained vertical slices  
✅ **Separation of Concerns**: Clear layer boundaries  
✅ **Interface-Based Design**: Depend on abstractions  

---

## 🎯 Key Benefits

### For Developers

✅ **Clear Structure**: Easy to find files  
✅ **Reduced Complexity**: Single responsibility modules  
✅ **Better Testability**: Test components in isolation  
✅ **Improved Onboarding**: New developers understand quickly  
✅ **Scalable**: Add features without affecting existing code  
✅ **Maintainable**: Changes are localized  

### For AI Systems

✅ **Predictable Patterns**: Consistent file locations  
✅ **Clear Dependencies**: Obvious relationships  
✅ **Better Context**: Self-documenting structure  
✅ **Easier Generation**: Know where to place code  
✅ **Safer Modifications**: Understand change impact

## 🚀 Next Steps to Begin

### 1. Review Documentation (1-2 hours)

```bash
# Read in this order:
1. docs/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md          # Overview
2. docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md  # Architecture
3. docs/REFACTORING_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md    # Step-by-step
4. QUICK_REFERENCE.md                      # Quick lookup
```

### 2. Run Setup Script (5 minutes)

```powershell
# Creates all directories and files
pwsh scripts/setup-refactor-structure.ps1
```

### 3. Update TypeScript Configuration (10 minutes)

```bash
# Follow the guide:
docs/guides/TYPESCRIPT_PATH_ALIASES.md
```

Update `tsconfig.json` with new path aliases:

- `@/infrastructure/*`
- `@/features/*`
- `@/lib/*`
- `@/config/*`

### 4. Verify Setup (5 minutes)

```bash
pnpm build          # Should succeed
pnpm type-check     # Should pass
pnpm lint           # Should pass
```

### 5. Start Refactoring (Follow Checklist)
