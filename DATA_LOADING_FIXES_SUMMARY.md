# UI/UX Improvements and Data Loading Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

1. **Data Loading Issues**: Pages requiring refresh to see data
2. **Monthly Stipend Removal**: Already removed from gamification info

## Changes Made

### 1. Profile Page Data Loading Improvements (`app/profile/page.tsx`)

- Added automatic data refreshing with a `refreshAllData` function
- Implemented periodic data polling every 5 minutes to keep data fresh
- Added error handling with retry buttons for failed data loads
- Improved error messages and user feedback

### 2. Community Gamification Page Improvements (`app/community/gamification/page.tsx`)

- Added refresh button in the header for manual data refresh
- Implemented periodic data polling every 5 minutes
- Added retry functionality for failed data loads
- Improved error handling with clear error messages and retry options

### 3. Use Achievements Hook Improvements (`hooks/use-achievements.ts`)

- Added automatic data refreshing with `refreshData` function
- Implemented periodic data polling every 5 minutes
- Fixed type definitions by moving interfaces to the hook file
- Improved error handling and loading states

## Benefits

1. **Automatic Data Refreshing**: Users no longer need to manually refresh pages to see updated data
2. **Better Error Handling**: Clear error messages and retry options when data loading fails
3. **Improved User Experience**: Data stays current without user intervention
4. **Consistent UI**: Refresh buttons and loading states provide clear feedback

## Technical Implementation

- Used React's `useCallback` for efficient function memoization
- Implemented `setInterval` for periodic data polling
- Added proper cleanup of intervals to prevent memory leaks
- Used `Promise.allSettled` for parallel data fetching where applicable
- Enhanced error boundaries with user-friendly retry mechanisms

## Testing

All changes have been implemented with proper error handling and should work seamlessly with the existing application architecture.
