### 3. üßπ Code Cleanup - IN PROGRESS

**Files to Review**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `lib/faculty-data.ts` - Mock faculty/reviews data (types used, arrays UNUSED)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `lib/community-data.ts` - Mock replies data (UNUSED)

**Status**: Faculty and community systems already use real databases. Mock data files exist but are NOT used in production code. Can be:
1. Removed entirely
2. Kept as types-only file
3. Marked as deprecated with comments

**Recommendation**: Keep files for now as they define TypeScript interfaces that are used throughout the codebase. Add deprecation warnings.

psql -U postgres -d your_database -f supabase/migrations/20251011000000_create_gamification_tables.sql

-- Or in Supabase Dashboard:
-- Go to SQL Editor ‚Üí Run the migration script
```

### 2. Storage Setup:
- Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Storage
- Create bucket: `resources` (public: false)
- Set up RLS policies for bucket

### 3. Environment Variables:
Ensure these are set:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (for admin operations)

### 4. Test Resources Upload:

2. Click "Upload Resource"
3. Fill form and upload file
4. Verify appears in admin panel with status='pending'

### 5. Test Gamification:
1. Visit `/gamification` or `/leaderboard` page
2. Create a post (should unlock "First Steps" achievement automatically - if auto-trigger implemented)
3. Check achievements appear in profile
4. Verify leaderboard shows rankings

---

## üéØ Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Auto-Achievement Unlock:
Add triggers to automatically unlock achievements when criteria are met:

**Example**: Unlock "First Steps" when user creates first post:
```typescript
// In POST /api/community/posts
if (userPostCount === 1) {
  await fetch('/api/gamification/unlock', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ achievement_id: 'first-steps-uuid' })
  })
}
```

**Places to add achievement checks**:
- Post creation ‚Üí Check post count achievements
- Comment creation ‚Üí Check comment achievements
- Like received ‚Üí Check popularity achievements
- Resource upload ‚Üí Check contributor achievements
- Paper upload ‚Üí Check paper contributor achievements

- User's unlocked achievements
- Progress bars toward next achievements
- Leaderboard position
- Recent activity

### Achievement Notifications:
When achievement unlocked:
- Show animated modal/toast
- Send notification via notification system
- Display on profile

## üìù Notes

### Resources Table Schema:
The `resources` table needs these columns (if not already present):
```sql
ALTER TABLE resources ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending';
ALTER TABLE resources ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS uploaded_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id);
ALTER TABLE resources ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS storage_path TEXT;
ALTER TABLE resources ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS size_bytes BIGINT;
ALTER TABLE resources ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS mime_type TEXT;
```

### Storage Bucket:
Create storage bucket if it doesn't exist:
```sql
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public) 
VALUES ('resources', 'resources', false)
ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;
```

### Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Upload resource as authenticated user
- [ ] Upload resource as anonymous user (should be rate-limited more)
- [ ] Try uploading file > 50MB (should fail)
- [ ] Try uploading invalid file type (should fail)
- [ ] Check admin panel shows pending resource
- [ ] Unlock first achievement
- [ ] Check leaderboard shows correct ranking
- [ ] Check user stats update correctly
