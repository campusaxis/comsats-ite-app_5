## 🛠️ Technical Fixes Applied

### Schema Corrections:
```javascript
// BEFORE (Wrong)
community_posts: {
  author_name: 'string', // ❌ Column doesn't exist
  author_avatar: 'string', // ❌ Column doesn't exist
  ...
}

// AFTER (Correct)
community_posts: {
  user_id: 'uuid', // ✅ Correct - references auth.users
  title: 'text', // ✅ Correct
  content: 'text', // ✅ Correct
  type: 'text', // ✅ Correct
  tags: 'text[]', // ✅ Correct
  likes: 'integer', // ✅ Correct
  comments: 'integer', // ✅ Correct
  shares: 'integer', // ✅ Correct
}

help_desk_tickets: {
  student_email: 'string', // ❌ Column doesn't exist
  // Changed to:
  student_name: 'string', // ✅ Correct
  student_id: 'string', // ✅ Correct
  user_id: 'uuid', // ✅ Optional FK to auth.users
}

news: 'table_name' // ❌ Wrong table name
// Changed to:
news_items: 'table_name' // ✅ Correct table name
```

### Foreign Key Handling:
```javascript
// Solution: Get real user from auth.users or use null
const { data: users } = await supabase.auth.admin.listUsers();
const userId = users?.users?.[0]?.id || null;

// Use real user ID in inserts
{
  user_id: userId, // ✅ Valid FK or null
  ...
}
```

## 🚀 How Seeding Was Done

### Step 1: Schema Discovery
```bash
# Checked actual table schemas in migration files
grep -r "CREATE TABLE.*community_posts" supabase/migrations/
grep -r "CREATE TABLE.*help_desk_tickets" supabase/migrations/
grep -r "CREATE TABLE.*news" supabase/migrations/

# Found:
- community_posts (user_id, title, content, type, tags, likes, comments, shares)
- help_desk_tickets (title, description, category, priority, status, student_name, student_id, user_id)
- news_items (title, content, category, is_important, image_url, author_id)
```

### Step 2: Foreign Key Resolution
```javascript
// Get real user ID from auth.users
const { data: users } = await supabase.auth.admin.listUsers();
const userId = users?.users?.[0]?.id;

// Use in inserts to satisfy FK constraints
user_id: userId // ✅ Valid FK reference
```

### Step 3: Unique Constraint Handling
```javascript
// For post_reactions (unique: post_id + user_id + reaction_type)
// Solution: Use different reaction_types per post
posts.forEach((post, index) => {
  reactions.push({
    post_id: post.id,
    user_id: userId,
    reaction_type: types[index % types.length] // Different type each time
  });
});
```

### Step 4: Seeding Execution
```bash
# Seed all tables
node scripts/seed-with-fk-fix.js

# Add reactions separately
node scripts/add-reactions.js

# Verify everything
node scripts/final-verification.js
```
