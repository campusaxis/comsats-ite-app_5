# Community & Guidance Features Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Guidance Page - "Failed to fetch guidance data" Error**

**Root Cause:** 
- The `.env.local` file was configured to use `localhost:54321` (local Supabase) instead of the production Supabase URL
- Database tables `guidance_content` and `faq_items` existed but might not have had seed data

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ Updated `.env.local` to use production Supabase URL: `https://ctixprrqbnfivhepifsa.supabase.co`
- ✅ Updated Supabase anon key to match production
- ✅ Added proper error handling in guidance page to show fallback data
- ✅ Created seed data script (`scripts/seed-and-test.js`) to populate guidance and FAQ data
- ✅ Verified data exists in database (at least 1 record for each table)

### 2. **Community Page - Not Fully Functional**

**Root Cause:**
- API was using `community_posts_enhanced` table which doesn't exist in production
- The actual table name is `community_posts` with a different schema
- Missing `post_reactions` and `post_comments` tables for likes and comments functionality

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ Updated `/api/community/posts/route.ts` to use `community_posts` table
- ✅ Fixed post transformation logic to work with simpler schema
- ✅ Updated like endpoint to use `community_posts` and `post_reactions` tables
- ✅ Created migration script (`supabase/migrations/20251012_fix_community_schema.sql`) to add missing tables:
  - `post_reactions` - for likes/reactions
  - `post_comments` - for comments/replies
- ✅ Added proper indexes for performance
- ✅ Added Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all tables

### 3. **Database Schema Improvements**

Created the following tables if they don't exist:
- `post_reactions` - tracks likes and reactions with proper foreign keys
- `post_comments` - stores comments and replies with threading support

Added indexes for performance:
- `idx_post_reactions_post_id`
- `idx_post_reactions_user_id`
- `idx_post_comments_post_id`
- `idx_post_comments_user_id`
- `idx_community_posts_user_id`
- `idx_community_posts_created_at`

Added RLS policies for security:
- Public can view all content
- Authenticated users can create content
- Users can only edit/delete their own content

## Files Modified

### Configuration Files
- `.env.local` - Updated Supabase URL and keys

### Application Files
- `app/guidance/page.tsx` - Improved error handling
- `app/api/community/posts/route.ts` - Fixed table references and schema
- `app/api/community/posts/[id]/like/route.ts` - Fixed table references
- `lib/supabase-utils.ts` - Updated post transformation logic

### Database Files
- `supabase/migrations/20251012_fix_community_schema.sql` - New migration
- `scripts/seed-guidance-data.sql` - Seed data for guidance
- `scripts/seed-and-test.js` - Automated seed and test script

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Apply Database Migration

Run the migration to create missing tables:

```bash
# If using Supabase CLI locally
supabase migration up

# OR run the SQL directly in Supabase Dashboard
# Copy content from: supabase/migrations/20251012_fix_community_schema.sql
# Paste into SQL Editor in Supabase Dashboard and execute
```

### 2. Seed Data (if needed)

If guidance/FAQ data is missing:

```bash
cd e:\comsats-ite-app_5
node scripts/seed-and-test.js
```

### 3. Start Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### 4. Test the Pages

**Guidance Page:**
- Visit: http://localhost:3000/guidance
- Should see guidance content cards
- Should see FAQ accordion
- Should NOT see "Failed to fetch guidance data" error

**Community Page:**
- Visit: http://localhost:3000/community
- Should see community posts
- Should be able to create new posts (if logged in)
- Should be able to like posts (if logged in)
- Should be able to comment on posts (if logged in)

## Production Deployment

### Before Deploying:

1. **Run the migration** on production Supabase:
   ```sql
   -- Copy and execute content from:
   -- supabase/migrations/20251012_fix_community_schema.sql
   ```

2. **Verify environment variables** in Vercel/deployment platform:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` = https://ctixprrqbnfivhepifsa.supabase.co
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` = (production anon key)
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` = (production service role key)

3. **Build and deploy:**
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   # Then deploy to Vercel or your platform
   ```

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Guidance page loads without errors
- [ ] Guidance content cards are visible
- [ ] FAQ section works with accordion
- [ ] Community page loads without errors
- [ ] Community posts are visible
- [ ] Can create new posts (when authenticated)
- [ ] Can like/unlike posts (when authenticated)
- [ ] Can comment on posts (when authenticated)
- [ ] All API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Database tables exist and have proper RLS policies

## Additional Notes

### Fallback Data
The guidance page now has built-in fallback data that displays even if the API fails. This ensures users always see something useful even if there are temporary connection issues.

### Performance Optimizations
- Added caching headers to API responses (5 minutes cache)
- Added database indexes for faster queries
- Optimized queries to select only necessary fields

### Security
- All tables have Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- Public can view content
- Only authenticated users can create content
- Users can only modify their own content

## Troubleshooting

### If guidance page still shows errors:
1. Check browser console for detailed error messages
2. Verify Supabase URL in `.env.local` is correct
3. Check if data exists: Run `node scripts/seed-and-test.js`
4. Check Supabase Dashboard logs for any database errors

### If community posts don't load:
1. Check if `community_posts` table exists in Supabase
2. Run migration: `supabase/migrations/20251012_fix_community_schema.sql`
3. Check browser console for API errors
4. Verify authentication is working (for creating posts)

### If likes/comments don't work:
1. Ensure `post_reactions` and `post_comments` tables exist
2. Run the migration if tables are missing
3. Check RLS policies are enabled and configured correctly
4. Verify user is authenticated
