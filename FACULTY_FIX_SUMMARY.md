# Faculty Loading Error Fix Summary

## Problem
The faculty page at https://campusaxis.site/faculty was showing an error:
```
Error Loading Faculty
column faculty.status does not exist
```

## Root Cause
The API route `/api/faculty` was trying to filter faculty by `status = 'approved'`, but the faculty table didn't have a status column.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed the API Route
Updated `app/api/faculty/route.ts` to properly use the status column after it's added to the database.

### 2. Created Database Migration
Created migration file `supabase/migrations/20251009270000_add_faculty_status_column.sql` with:

```sql
-- Add status column to faculty table
ALTER TABLE faculty 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS status TEXT DEFAULT 'approved' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'approved', 'rejected'));

-- Create index for better query performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_faculty_status ON faculty(status);

-- Add comment for documentation
COMMENT ON COLUMN faculty.status IS 'Approval status: pending, approved, or rejected';

-- Update existing faculty to have approved status
UPDATE faculty SET status = 'approved' WHERE status IS NULL;
```

### 3. Added Documentation
Created `FACULTY_STATUS_FIX.md` with detailed instructions on how to apply the fix.

## Files Modified
1. `app/api/faculty/route.ts` - Fixed to use status column properly
2. `supabase/migrations/20251009270000_add_faculty_status_column.sql` - Migration to add status column
3. `FACULTY_STATUS_FIX.md` - Documentation for the fix

## How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Using Supabase CLI (if you have local development setup)
```bash
npx supabase migration up
```

### Option 2: Direct SQL Execution (for production database)
Execute the SQL from the migration file directly on your production database.

## Verification Steps
1. After applying the migration, visit https://campusaxis.site/faculty
2. The page should load without errors
3. Faculty members should be displayed
4. The API endpoint `/api/faculty` should return data without errors

## Future Benefits
This fix enables a proper faculty approval workflow:
- New faculty submissions can be added with status = 'pending'
- Admins can approve/reject faculty submissions
- Only approved faculty are shown to users
- Consistent with the existing `pending_faculty` table workflow
