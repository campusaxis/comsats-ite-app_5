# Vercel Free Tier Optimization Guide

This guide outlines the optimizations implemented to reduce resource consumption and stay within Vercel's free tier limits.

## Resource Usage Analysis

Based on the provided metrics:
- Edge Requests: 126K / 1M (12.6%)
- ISR Writes: 20K / 200K (10%)
- Function Invocations: 99K / 1M (9.9%)
- Fast Origin Transfer: 805.02 MB / 10 GB (8%)
- ISR Reads: 56K / 1M (5.6%)
- Fluid Provisioned Memory: 10.9 GB-Hrs / 360 GB-Hrs (3%)
- Fast Data Transfer: 1.18 GB / 100 GB (1.18%)
- Edge Request CPU Duration: 6s / 1h (0.17%)
- Image Optimization - Transformations: 3 / 5K (0.06%)

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. API Route Caching

Added cache headers to API routes to reduce function invocations:
- Cache-Control: public, s-maxage=3600, stale-while-revalidate=1800
- CDN-Cache-Control: public, s-maxage=3600
- Vercel-CDN-Cache-Control: public, s-maxage=3600

This allows CDN to cache responses for 1 hour, significantly reducing serverless function invocations.

### 2. Client-Side Performance Optimizations

#### Timetable Page
- Implemented useMemo for expensive computations (filtering, sorting)
- Used useCallback for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Optimized state management to reduce component updates
- Added proper loading states to improve perceived performance

### 3. Data Fetching Optimizations

#### API Routes
- Added proper error handling to prevent infinite retry loops
- Implemented efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Reduced unnecessary data fetching by filtering at the database level

### 4. Image Optimization

#### Next.js Configuration
- Enabled unoptimized: false in production to use Vercel's image optimization
- Configured remotePatterns for Supabase CDN images

### 5. Build and Deployment Optimizations

#### Next.js Configuration
- Enabled eslint and typescript checks only in development
- Added proper security headers without overloading responses

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Implement SWR or React Query
For more advanced caching and data synchronization:
```javascript
import useSWR from 'swr'

const fetcher = (url) => fetch(url).then((res) => res.json())

function TimetablePage() {
  const { data: docs, error } = useSWR('/api/timetable-docs', fetcher, {
    refreshInterval: 3600000, // 1 hour
    dedupingInterval: 600000, // 10 minutes
  })
  
  // ... rest of component
}
```

### 2. Lazy Loading Components
Implement lazy loading for non-critical components:
```javascript
import { lazy, Suspense } from 'react'

const HeavyComponent = lazy(() => import('@/components/heavy-component'))

function Page() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <HeavyComponent />
    </Suspense>
  )
}
```

### 3. Bundle Size Optimization
- Use dynamic imports for large libraries
- Remove unused dependencies
- Enable code splitting

### 4. Database Query Optimization
- Add proper indexes to frequently queried columns
- Use SELECT with specific columns instead of *
- Implement pagination for large datasets

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### 1. Regular Resource Monitoring
- Monitor Vercel Analytics dashboard
- Set up alerts for resource usage thresholds
- Review and optimize periodically

### 2. Cache Invalidation Strategy
- Implement cache tags for selective invalidation
- Use webhook-based cache clearing for content updates
- Plan cache invalidation during low-traffic periods

### 3. Performance Testing
- Regularly test with Lighthouse
- Monitor Core Web Vitals
- Optimize for mobile performance

## Expected Impact

These optimizations should reduce:
- Function invocations by 40-60%
- ISR writes by 30-50%
- Edge requests by 20-30%
- Overall resource consumption by 30-50%
