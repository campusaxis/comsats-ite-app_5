# Shared Library

This directory contains shared utilities, helpers, constants, and types.

## Structure

- **utils/**: Pure utility functions (no side effects)
- **helpers/**: Helper functions with side effects
- **constants/**: Application constants
- **types/**: Shared TypeScript types

## Rules

- Keep functions small and focused
- Pure utilities in utils/
- Side effects in helpers/
- Well-documented and tested
