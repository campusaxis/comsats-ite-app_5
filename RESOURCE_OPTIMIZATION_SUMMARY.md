# Resource Optimization Summary

This document summarizes all the optimizations implemented to reduce resource consumption and stay within Vercel's free tier limits.

## Overview

Based on the initial resource usage metrics:
- Edge Requests: 126K / 1M (12.6%)
- ISR Writes: 20K / 200K (10%)
- Function Invocations: 99K / 1M (9.9%)
- Fast Origin Transfer: 805.02 MB / 10 GB (8%)
- ISR Reads: 56K / 1M (5.6%)
- Fluid Provisioned Memory: 10.9 GB-Hrs / 360 GB-Hrs (3%)
- Fast Data Transfer: 1.18 GB / 100 GB (1.18%)
- Edge Request CPU Duration: 6s / 1h (0.17%)
- Image Optimization - Transformations: 3 / 5K (0.06%)

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. API Route Caching

**Files Modified:**
- `app/api/timetable-docs/route.ts`
- `app/api/campuses/route.ts`
- `app/api/departments/route.ts`

**Changes:**
- Added cache headers to reduce function invocations:
  ```javascript
  const headers = {
    'Cache-Control': 'public, s-maxage=3600, stale-while-revalidate=1800',
    'CDN-Cache-Control': 'public, s-maxage=3600',
    'Vercel-CDN-Cache-Control': 'public, s-maxage=3600'
  }
  ```
- This allows CDN to cache responses for 1 hour, significantly reducing serverless function invocations.

### 2. Client-Side Performance Optimizations

**Files Modified:**
- `app/timetable/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Implemented `useMemo` for expensive computations (filtering, sorting)
- Used `useCallback` for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Optimized state management to reduce component updates
- Added proper loading states to improve perceived performance

### 3. Data Fetching Optimizations

**Files Modified:**
- `contexts/campus-context.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Implemented simple in-memory caching for API responses
- Added 30-minute cache duration for campus, department, and program data
- Reduced redundant API calls by checking cache first

### 4. Database Query Optimization

**Files Modified:**
- `supabase/migrations/20251009155602_add_campus_department_to_timetable_docs.sql`

**Changes:**
- Added indexes on `campus_id` and `department_id` columns for better query performance
- Proper foreign key constraints for data integrity

## Expected Impact

These optimizations should reduce:

1. **Function Invocations**: 40-60% reduction through CDN caching
2. **ISR Writes**: 30-50% reduction through efficient caching strategies
3. **Edge Requests**: 20-30% reduction through client-side caching
4. **Overall Resource Consumption**: 30-50% reduction across all metrics

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Implement SWR or React Query
For more advanced caching and data synchronization:
```bash
npm install swr
```

### 2. Bundle Size Optimization
- Analyze with `@next/bundle-analyzer`
- Remove unused dependencies
- Enable code splitting

### 3. Image Optimization
- Use Next.js Image component for all images
- Implement proper image sizing
- Use WebP format where possible

## Monitoring Plan

1. **Weekly Resource Usage Reviews**
   - Check Vercel Analytics dashboard
   - Compare usage against free tier limits

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Run Lighthouse audits monthly
   - Monitor Core Web Vitals
   - Test mobile performance

3. **Cache Effectiveness**
   - Monitor cache hit rates
   - Adjust cache durations based on data volatility
   - Implement cache warming for critical endpoints

## Conclusion

The implemented optimizations should keep the application well within Vercel's free tier limits while maintaining good performance. The combination of CDN caching, client-side optimizations, and efficient data fetching should significantly reduce resource consumption.

Regular monitoring and periodic adjustments will ensure continued compliance with free tier limits as the application grows.
