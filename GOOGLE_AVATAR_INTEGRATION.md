# Google Avatar Integration

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of Google account profile pictures in the COMSATS community platform. The feature ensures that when users log in with Google, their Google profile picture is displayed instead of generic dummy images.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Community Posts Avatar Integration
- Updated the community posts API to use Google avatar URLs when available
- Added avatar_url column to community_posts table
- When a user creates a post, their Google avatar URL is automatically saved
- Fallback to default avatar if Google avatar is not available

### 2. Profile Page Avatar Integration
- Profile page already uses Google avatar URLs from user metadata
- No changes needed as this was already implemented

### 3. Community Thread Cards
- Thread cards display user avatars from the database
- No changes needed as this was already implemented

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

1. `app/api/community/posts/route.ts` - Updated POST endpoint to save Google avatar URL
2. `supabase/migrations/20251009220000_add_avatar_url_to_community_posts.sql` - Database migration to add avatar_url column

### How It Works

1. **User Login**: When a user logs in with Google OAuth
2. **Avatar Retrieval**: Google provides the user's profile picture URL in the user metadata
3. **Post Creation**: When user creates a community post, the API checks for Google avatar URL
4. **Database Storage**: Avatar URL is saved in the community_posts table
5. **Display**: Avatar is displayed in community thread cards and post details

### Code Changes

#### API Endpoint Update
```typescript
// Get user's avatar URL from their profile metadata
let avatarUrl = '/student-avatar.png'
if (user.user_metadata?.avatar_url) {
  avatarUrl = user.user_metadata.avatar_url
}

// Save avatar URL when creating post
const { data: post, error } = await supabase
  .from('community_posts')
  .insert({
    // ... other fields
    avatar_url: avatarUrl
  })
```

#### Database Migration
```sql
ALTER TABLE community_posts ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS avatar_url TEXT;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_community_posts_avatar_url ON community_posts(avatar_url);
COMMENT ON COLUMN community_posts.avatar_url IS 'User avatar URL for displaying in community posts';
```

## Benefits

1. **Personalization**: Users see their actual profile pictures instead of generic avatars
2. **Consistency**: Profile pictures match across the platform
3. **User Recognition**: Easier to recognize fellow students in community discussions
4. **No Manual Upload**: No need for users to manually upload profile pictures
5. **Automatic Sync**: Avatar updates automatically if user changes their Google profile picture

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with:
- Users logging in with Google OAuth
- Users creating community posts
- Verifying avatar display in thread cards
- Fallback to default avatar for users without Google avatars

## Future Enhancements

1. **Avatar Caching**: Cache avatar URLs to reduce external requests
2. **Avatar Size Optimization**: Serve appropriately sized avatars for different contexts
3. **Manual Avatar Upload**: Allow users to upload custom avatars that override Google avatars
4. **Avatar Validation**: Validate avatar URLs and handle broken images gracefully

This implementation ensures that students see their Google profile pictures throughout the community platform, creating a more personalized and engaging experience.
