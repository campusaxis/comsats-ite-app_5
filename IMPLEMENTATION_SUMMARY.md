- Level up, badge earning, and milestone celebrations
- Contextual messaging and duration settings

## Integration Points

### 1. Form Submissions
- Automatic celebration animations on successful form submissions
- Customizable messages and animation types
- Loading states with animation feedback

### 2. Gamification System
- Achievement badges that trigger celebrations when earned
- Level up animations for progress milestones
- XP gain visual feedback

### 3. User Interactions
- Button clicks with ripple effects

- Input validation with success animations

## Accessibility Features

### 1. Reduced Motion Support
- All animations respect the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
- Automatic simplification or disabling of animations when needed
- Smooth transitions even with reduced motion enabled

### 2. Performance Optimization
- Hardware-accelerated animations using CSS transforms
- Automatic performance scaling on mobile devices
- Proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks

### 3. User Preferences
- Animation intensity settings (low, medium, high)
- Global enable/disable toggle
- Persistent user preferences storage

## Styling Integration

### 1. Glassmorphism Design
- Animations work seamlessly with the existing glass effect classes
- Proper blending with glass cards and buttons
- Consistent design language throughout

### 2. Dark Mode Support
- Animations adapt to dark mode color schemes
- Proper contrast for all animation elements
- Consistent appearance in both light and dark modes

## Usage Examples

### Basic Celebration
```typescript
import { useCelebrationAnimations } from '@/hooks/use-celebration-animations'

const { triggerConfetti } = useCelebrationAnimations()

triggerConfetti({
  message: 'Congratulations! Task completed successfully!',
  duration: 5000
})
```

### Achievement Celebration
```typescript
const { triggerAchievement } = useCelebrationAnimations()

triggerAchievement({
  title: 'Level 10 Explorer',
  description: 'You\'ve completed 50 challenges!',
  type: 'milestone'
})
```

### Celebration Sequence
```typescript
const { triggerCelebrationSequence } = useCelebrationAnimations()

triggerCelebrationSequence({
  message: 'Outstanding achievement! You\'ve completed all tasks!',
  effects: ['confetti', 'balloons', 'lights', 'ribbons']
})
```

## Testing

All new components have been tested for:
- Proper rendering in both light and dark modes
- Accessibility compliance with reduced motion preferences
- Performance on various device sizes
- Integration with existing animation system
- Error handling and edge cases

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Additional Animation Types
- Particle systems for more complex effects
- 3D animations using Three.js
- SVG-based animations for better performance

### 2. Advanced Customization
