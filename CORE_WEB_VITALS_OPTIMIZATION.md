# Core Web Vitals Optimization Plan

## Current Issues
Based on the Google Search Console report, your site has critical Core Web Vitals issues:
1. **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) Issue**: Longer than 4s on mobile
2. **INP (Interaction to Next Paint) Issue**: Longer than 200ms on mobile
3. **LCP Issue**: Longer than 2.5s on mobile (less severe)

## Root Causes Analysis

### 1. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) Issues
Potential causes:
- Large, unoptimized images
- Render-blocking resources
- Slow server response times
- Heavy JavaScript bundles
- Complex CSS animations

### 2. Interaction to Next Paint (INP) Issues
Potential causes:
- Heavy JavaScript execution on interaction
- Complex animations on interaction
- Large bundle sizes affecting responsiveness
- Main thread blocking operations

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Image Optimization
- Enable Next.js Image Optimization
- Implement proper image sizing
- Use modern image formats (WebP)
- Add loading="lazy" to non-critical images
- Implement image placeholders

### 2. JavaScript Bundle Optimization
- Code splitting for large components
- Dynamic imports for non-critical features
- Remove unused dependencies
- Optimize third-party scripts
- Implement route-based code splitting

### 3. CSS and Animation Optimization
- Reduce complex animations
- Optimize CSS selectors
- Remove unused CSS
- Implement critical CSS
- Defer non-critical CSS

### 4. Server-Side Rendering Improvements
- Optimize API response times
- Implement proper caching
- Reduce server-side computation
- Use ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) where appropriate

### 5. Resource Loading Optimization
- Preload critical resources
- Defer non-critical JavaScript
- Optimize font loading
- Minimize third-party scripts

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Fixes (1-2 days)
1. Enable Next.js image optimization
2. Add loading="lazy" to images
3. Optimize font loading
4. Implement proper caching headers

### Phase 2: Bundle Optimization (3-5 days)
1. Analyze bundle sizes
2. Implement code splitting
3. Optimize third-party dependencies
4. Remove unused code

### Phase 3: Advanced Optimizations (1-2 weeks)
1. Implement ISR for static content
2. Optimize animations and interactions
3. Fine-tune caching strategies
4. Monitor performance metrics

## Files to Modify

### 1. next.config.mjs
- Enable image optimization
- Add performance headers

### 2. app/layout.tsx
- Optimize font loading
- Add performance monitoring

### 3. GPA Calculator Pages
- Optimize images and components
- Implement lazy loading for calculators

### 4. Components
- Optimize heavy components
- Implement dynamic imports

## Monitoring and Testing

### Tools to Use
1. Google PageSpeed Insights
2. Lighthouse audits
3. Web.dev measure
4. Chrome DevTools Performance panel

### Metrics to Track
1. LCP (should be < 2.5s)
2. INP (should be < 200ms)
3. CLS (should be < 0.1)
4. FID (should be < 100ms)

## Expected Outcomes

After implementing these optimizations, we expect to see:
- LCP reduced to under 2.5 seconds
- INP reduced to under 200ms
- Overall better user experience
- Improved search rankings

## Next Steps

1. Implement immediate image optimizations
2. Run performance audits
3. Analyze bundle sizes
4. Implement code splitting
5. Monitor Core Web Vitals in Search Console
