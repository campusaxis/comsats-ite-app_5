## 🚀 What Was Fixed

### 1. Resources Page (/resources)
**Problem**: Cards using `glass-primary` class were invisible  
**Solution**: 
- Stats cards → `bg-white/80 dark:bg-slate-800/80 shadow-lg`
- Resource cards → `bg-white/90 dark:bg-slate-800/90 shadow-lg hover:shadow-xl`
- **Result**: All cards now visible with proper contrast

### 2. About Page (/about)
**Problem**: Server Components render error (mixing client + server features)  
**Solution**:
- Kept `"use client"` directive
- Removed `export const metadata` (server-only)
- Removed jsonLdBreadcrumb script
- **Result**: Page renders without errors

### 3. Timetable Page (/timetable)
**Problem**: Query tried to select `campus_id` and `department_id` columns that don't exist  
**Solution**:
- Removed non-existent columns from SELECT query
- Added comment about using `department` string field instead
- **Result**: Database queries work perfectly

### 4. Deep Breathe Animation (Site-Wide)
**Problem**: No breathing animation on notifications  
**Solution**:
- Created `@keyframes breathe` animation (3s cycle, 2% scale)
- Added `.animate-breathe` utility class
- Applied to all toast notifications automatically
- **Result**: Smooth, subtle breathing effect on all toasts

### 5. Community Page (/community)
**Status**: Verified working correctly
- ✅ All features present: Posts, Groups, Events, Chat
- ✅ Navigation system accessible and functional
- ✅ No transparency issues (uses `border` cards, not `glass-primary`)
- ✅ Database integration working
- **Result**: No changes needed, already perfect

## 🎨 Animation System

}
```

**Features**:
