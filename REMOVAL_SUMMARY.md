## Benefits

This cleanup provides several benefits:
1. **Reduced clutter** - Removed outdated and duplicate documentation
2. **Improved maintainability** - Eliminated unnecessary files that could cause confusion
3. **Faster builds** - Fewer files to process during build operations
4. **Clearer project structure** - Easier to navigate the codebase
5. **Reduced storage** - Significant reduction in project size

The project now has a cleaner, more focused structure while maintaining all essential functionality and current documentation.
