# 🎯 QUICK FIX SUMMARY

## Issue: Filtering Box & Components Too Transparent

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

---

## What Was Wrong ❌

1. **Filtering box** had 50% opacity (bg-white/50) - too transparent to read
2. **Inputs and selects** washed out and hard to see
3. **Buttons** not clearly visible
4. **Glass utilities** had too low opacity across the board

---

## What Was Fixed ✅

### 1. Filtering Box (`components/search/advanced-filter-bar.tsx`)
- ✅ Search input: Now uses `glass-input` (75% opacity)
- ✅ Dropdowns: Now use `glass-input` + `glass-modal` (98% for content)
- ✅ Buttons: Now use `glass-interactive` (75% opacity)
- ✅ Container: Now uses `glass-card` (80% opacity)
- ✅ **9 replacements made**

### 2. Glass Utilities (`styles/utilities/glass-utilities.css`)
- ✅ `glass-card`: 70% → **80%** (light), 55% → **70%** (dark)
- ✅ `glass-input`: 50% → **75%** (light), 50% → **70%** (dark)
- ✅ `glass-interactive`: 65% → **75%** (light), 60% → **70%** (dark)
- ✅ `glass-modal`: 95% → **98%** (light), 90% → **95%** (dark)

### 3. Footer
- ✅ Already using `glass-footer` correctly - no changes needed
