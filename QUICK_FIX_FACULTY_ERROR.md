ALTER TABLE faculty 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS status TEXT DEFAULT 'approved'

## üîç Why This Happened
The `faculty` table was missing the `status` column that the API endpoint expects. This column is used to filter approved vs pending faculty members.

## üéØ What This Does
- ‚úÖ Adds `status` column with default value `'approved'`
- ‚úÖ Creates index for fast queries
- ‚úÖ Updates all existing faculty to approved status
- ‚úÖ Allows only valid statuses: pending, approved, rejected

---

## üöÄ After Fixing

Your faculty page should now show all faculty members with proper filtering!

If you still see issues:
1. Check browser console for other errors (F12)
2. Verify Supabase connection in .env.local
3. Check RLS policies allow public read access to faculty table

## üìû Need Help?
If the error persists, check:
- Supabase RLS policies (make sure `select` is enabled for `faculty` table)
- Environment variables are set correctly
- Database connection is working

**Quick RLS Fix (if needed):**
```sql
-- Enable read access to faculty table
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access to approved faculty"
ON faculty FOR SELECT
USING (status = 'approved');
```

‚úÖ **This should fix your faculty page immediately!**
