# Mobile Responsiveness Plan for CampusAxis PWA

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive plan to ensure all 108 pages in the CampusAxis project are fully responsive for the PWA mobile experience. The project already has a solid foundation for mobile responsiveness, but we'll systematically verify and enhance each page.

## Current State Analysis
Based on the audit of key pages, the project already implements:
- Responsive grid layouts using Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-specific components (e.g., MobileCommunityView)
- Proper viewport settings in the main layout
- PWA manifest configuration
- Mobile-friendly touch targets and interactions
- Media queries for different screen sizes

### 3. Implementation Steps

#### Phase 1: Critical Pages (High Priority)
1. Home page (/)
2. Community pages (/community/*)
3. Faculty directory (/faculty)
4. Past papers (/past-papers/*)
5. GPA calculator (/gpa-calculator/*)
6. Guidance portal (/guidance)
7. Admin dashboard (/admin/*)

#### Phase 2: User-Facing Pages (Medium Priority)
