### Database Migrations
**Files**: 
- `supabase/migrations/20251008184000_seed_campuses_departments.sql`

These files still contain phone numbers in the data, but they are not displayed in the UI after the changes above.

## Verification

All changes have been made to remove phone number displays while maintaining:
1. All other contact information (email, address)
2. Faculty profile completeness
3. Form functionality (phone remains optional in forms)
4. Data integrity (phone numbers still stored in database)

The changes ensure that no phone numbers are visible to users throughout the platform while preserving the ability to collect this information if needed in the future.
