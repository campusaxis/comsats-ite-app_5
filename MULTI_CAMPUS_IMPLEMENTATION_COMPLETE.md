## 🗄️ Database Migrations

### Migration Files
1. **20251008183000_multi_campus_system.sql**
   - Creates 4 new tables (campuses, departments, programs, user_preferences)
   - Adds foreign keys to 10+ existing tables
   - Creates indexes for performance
   - Sets up RLS policies
   - Uses conditional ALTER TABLE with error handling

2. **20251008184000_seed_campuses_departments.sql**
   - Seeds 8 COMSATS campuses (Lahore as default)
   - Seeds 10+ departments for each campus
   - Creates sample degree programs
   - Updates existing NULL campus_id to Lahore
   - Handles missing tables gracefully

### Migration Status
✅ Both migrations successfully applied
✅ All tables created
✅ All seed data inserted
✅ Lahore set as default campus (is_default = true)

9. API routes filter data by campus_id
10. Only campus-specific data returned
```

### On Campus Change
```
1. User clicks campus selector
2. User selects new campus
3. CampusProvider updates selectedCampus
4. CampusProvider saves to localStorage
5. CampusProvider saves to database (if logged in)
6. All pages detect selectedCampus change (useEffect)

- Clear, descriptive naming throughout

### Error Handling
- Conditional ALTER TABLE statements prevent migration failures
- Graceful handling of missing tables
- Try-catch blocks in API routes
- User-friendly error messages

### Performance
