### 🎯 Overview
Successfully implemented **fully functional student profiles with real data** and **complete campus context integration** across all features for the COMSATS ITE Application.

## 📊 1. Real Profile Data System

### **Profile Stats API (`/api/profile/stats`)**
✅ **Complete Rewrite** - Now fetches real data from database:

**Data Sources:**
- `community_posts` → Posts Created count
- `reviews` → Reviews Written count  
- `help_desk_tickets` → Tickets Created count
- `past_papers` → Papers Uploaded count
- Aggregate likes from community posts → Total Likes
- `user_preferences` joined with `campuses`, `departments` → Campus & Department names
- `auth.users.user_metadata` → Student ID, Full Name, Join Date

**Returns:**
```typescript
{
  postsCreated: number,
  reviewsWritten: number,
  ticketsCreated: number,
  papersUploaded: number,
  totalLikes: number,
  campusName: string,
  departmentName: string,
  semester: number | null,
  studentId: string | null,
  fullName: string,
  joinDate: string,
  profileComplete: boolean
}
```

### **Account Management API (`/api/account`)**
✅ **Enhanced with Full CRUD:**

**GET Method:**
- Fetches complete user profile
- Joins `user_preferences` with `campuses`, `departments`, `programs` tables
- Returns user metadata + preferences + academic info

**PATCH Method:**
- Updates `auth.users.user_metadata` (student_id, full_name)
- Updates/inserts `user_preferences` table (campus_id, department_id, program_id, semester)
- Validates all input data
- Returns success/error responses

**DELETE Method:**
