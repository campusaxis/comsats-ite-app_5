### 🎯 Next Steps for Full Completion

The database schema is ready and one example page (Student Portal) is complete. To finish the remaining features, you need to:

#### 1. Create API Routes (15-20 min each):
```
app/api/scholarships/route.ts
app/api/merit-lists/route.ts
app/api/lms-troubleshooting/route.ts
app/api/student-portal/resources/route.ts
app/api/fee-challans/route.ts
app/api/community/comments/route.ts
```

#### 2. Create Pages (20-30 min each):
```
app/scholarships/page.tsx
app/merit-list-2025/page.tsx
