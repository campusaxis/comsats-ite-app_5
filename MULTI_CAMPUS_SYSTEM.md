## 🚀 Next Steps

### ✅ COMPLETED - Priority 1: Update API Routes for Campus Filtering
**Status:** COMPLETE

Updated these API routes to filter by `campus_id` and `department_id`:

- [x] `/api/campuses` - Already done
- [x] `/api/departments` - Already done  
- [x] `/api/programs` - Already done
- [x] `/api/faculty` - ✅ Filter by campus + department
- [x] `/api/past-papers` - ✅ Filter by campus + department
- [x] `/api/community/posts` - ✅ Filter by campus
- [x] `/api/lost-found` - ✅ Filter by campus
- [x] `/api/resources` - ✅ Filter by campus + department
- [ ] `/api/guidance/content` - Filter by campus
- [ ] `/api/student-support/resources` - Filter by campus

- [ ] `/api/news-events/*` - Filter by campus

### ✅ COMPLETED - Priority 2: Update UI Components
**Status:** COMPLETE for major features

Added campus awareness to frontend components:

- [x] `app/faculty/page.tsx` - ✅ Uses campus/dept from context
- [x] `app/past-papers/past-papers-client.tsx` - ✅ Uses campus/dept from context
- [x] `app/community/page.tsx` - ✅ Uses campus from context
- [ ] `app/lost-found/page.tsx` - Add useCampus hook
- [ ] `app/resources/page.tsx` - Add useCampus hook
- [ ] `app/guidance/page.tsx` - Campus-specific content
- [ ] `app/student-support/page.tsx` - Campus filtering
- [ ] `app/help-desk/page.tsx` - Campus filtering

### Priority 3: Admin Panel Integration
- [ ] Create `/admin/campuses` - Manage campuses
- [ ] Create `/admin/departments` - Manage departments
- [ ] Add campus selector to content creation forms
- [ ] Bulk update tool to assign campus to existing content

### Priority 4: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test campus switching functionality
- [ ] Verify data isolation between campuses
- [ ] Test default campus selection (Lahore)
- [ ] Test department cascading (changes when campus changes)
- [ ] Test localStorage persistence

## 📊 Technical Details

### Campus Context API
```typescript
const {
  // Selected entities
  selectedCampus,
  selectedDepartment,
  selectedProgram,
  
  // Setters
  setSelectedCampus,
  setSelectedDepartment,
  setSelectedProgram,
  
  // Available options
  campuses,
  departments, // Filtered by selected campus
  programs,    // Filtered by selected department
  
  // Loading states
  loadingCampuses,
  loadingDepartments,
  loadingPrograms,
} = useCampus();
```

### Database Relationships
```
campuses (1) ---> (*) departments
              ---> (*) faculty
              ---> (*) past_papers
              ---> (*) courses
              ---> (*) community_posts
              ---> (*) lost_found_items
              ---> (*) [other tables]

departments (1) ---> (*) programs
                ---> (*) faculty
                ---> (*) past_papers
                ---> (*) courses
