- **Installable**: Manifest file enables home screen installation
- **Push Notifications**: Infrastructure for push notifications
- **Background Sync**: Support for offline actions that sync when online

### Code Quality
- **Modularization**: Refactored community feature into maintainable components
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear division between UI, logic, and data layers
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each component and function has a single purpose
- **Scalability**: Architecture designed for future growth

## Testing and Validation

### Device Testing
- Tested on various mobile devices (4" to 12"+ screens)
- Verified on iOS and Android platforms
- Confirmed compatibility with major mobile browsers
- Validated performance on 3G/4G networks

### Automated Testing
